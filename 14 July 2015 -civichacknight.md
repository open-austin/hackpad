From Angela Hanson (City of Austin Innovation Office): The Innovation Office is working with Austin Resource Recovery, the city's garbage and recycling collection department, on a new civic engagement tool called Insights. Instead of asking the public for suggestions in a way that feels like a big black box, this tool allows users to contribute their suggestions, find insights among other users' suggestions, and at the end of the process, every participant is given personalized  feedback detailing how the city is addressing their suggestion. We would like to test this tool with as many channels as possible to see if it is something of long term value for the city as an engagement tool. If Open Austin folks could help spread among members' channels and networks, we would appreciate it.

If you have feedback about the tool itself, please let us know at innovation@austintexas.gov
