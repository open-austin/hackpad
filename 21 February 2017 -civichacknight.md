We also have a slack channel [#iced](https://openaustin.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23iced&via=XFYxW6kSZGE)-coffee, which is a great place to start, as well as new leadership team channels. 

_This will give us a place to point folks depending on how they would like to help and each team leader a place to organize their people and put out the call when there is a need._

## Personal Intros

*   **Name**
*   **Personal pronouns (she/her, they/them, he/him, ze/hir)**

        *   We use gender pronouns to make the space more comfortable and inclusive. People may appear differently than they identify. Knowing and asking someone's gender is better and less awkward than misgendering them. 

## Open Austin Project Process

**Code for America has the [four project stages](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages):**

*   experiment
*   alpha
*   beta
*   official

**To start an experiment:**

*   Do something and tell us about it. Open an issue at [](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues)[https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues) and tag it with experiment.
*   Tell us if you need any resources to get started (hosting, cartodb, mockup tools, etc.).
*   Come to an Open Austin event and work on/share your project.
*   Start a Slack channel.

**From experiment to alpha:**

(this is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project):

*   Identify a project champion
*   Get approval from Open Austin
*   List the project on [open-austin.org/projects](https://open-austin.org/projects)
*   Go through a code/architecture review
