**Title of your project:***

Council Connect

**Describe your project in 140 characters or less:***

Council Connect is an agenda item tracking app, including user account management to allow users to have the ability to manage their own text/email alert notifications on tags. 

**Please list tags related to your submission**

civic engagement, city council, agenda, policy, process

**Sponsor Category:***

Open Austin sponsored

**What is the problem you are trying to solve with this project?**

City Council has specifically mentioned community engagement as a priority, and an interest in providing alternative means for people to provide comment on agenda items. The current agenda management system provides export ability, which means that a lightweight app could be developed using the agenda export and adding a field for comment. Ideally, we'd tap into the parent company's API, but it's unclear whether it supports SIRE at this time.

**Describe: This project will help [WHO THIS WILL HELP?] by [DOING WHAT?] because [DESCRIBE THE INSIGHTFUL REASON WHY THEY NEED THIS]***

This project will help the citizens of Austin participate in City Council decision making by providing notifications of upcoming agenda items and deadlines to sign up for public testimony. This will enable citizens to keep tabs on decision making so they can participate before decisions are finalized because Council information is currently too fragmented across different pages on the City's website. 

**Describe the human(s) that this project will serve - for whom are you creating value?**

Help the citizens of Austin participate in City Council decision making. 

**Why are you passionate about your project idea? (Be as brief as possible)**

We believe that a vibrant democracy requires citizen participation. Austin's City Council process is currently difficult to follow even for those already engaged with specific issues.

**What do you hope or expect to have accomplished by the end of the hackathon weekend?**

We expect to have notifications for future items, the ability to search past items with suggested tags and a news feature combined in one app to make it easier for citizens to follow City Council events.
