# Civic Hacking 101

_This is an outline of a 15-minute orientation to give to new Civic Hackers:_

It’s ok if you don’t know Ruby, Python, and R. Why are they talking about jewelry and snakes? 

Your background is important, within government, as a project manager, as a policy expert, as a citizen. You don’t need to know how to code to be a civic hacker. 

Data is fuel for civic innovation. City of Austin’s data portal. It didn’t use to be this way. data would sit on city computers. Now everything is published in near time. Examples of datasets. 

One of the datasets the gets updated on a regular basis is _blank. 

Example of Pet Alerts. That is civic hacking in a nutshell. It’s taking data that is provided by the government to either educate about an issue or solve a civic problem.

The person that manages the austin portal is a friend of the organization. A great resource on how to use their api or what data means, they can point us in the right place 

Socrata’s API. Pull straight from data 

Open Source is like an open book test. You can see answers, how people got to their answers and it makes it easier to look things up. 

Example of an app on github posted on Github. How you can fork and redeploy. Think about a family tree. Don’t have to go through a big pre 

Pull Request. We made some changes to your app, we think you’d like them. Send them back. Collaborative environment, changes get pulled back into a main repo. 

Issue function in Github. You can chat and work on a project if even if you don’t know how to code.
