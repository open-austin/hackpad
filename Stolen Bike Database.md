**What is the problem you are trying to solve with this project?**

Recovering stolen bikes is nearly impossible and there is no known centralized database that can be cross referenced when buying/selling a bike.

**Describe: This project will help [WHO THIS WILL HELP?] by [DOING WHAT?] because [DESCRIBE THE INSIGHTFUL REASON WHY THEY NEED THIS]***

This project will help bike owners, pawn shop merchants, bike shoppers, and police by making it easier to search for stolen bikes because bike theft is rampant.

**Describe the human(s) that this project will serve - for whom are you creating value?**

Most cyclists in Austin have had the experience of their bike being stolen. The goal is to provide recourse for such bicyclists in the event that their bike goes missing
