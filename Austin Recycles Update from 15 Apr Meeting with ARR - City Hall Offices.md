# Austin Recycles Update from 15 Apr Meeting with ARR @ City Hall Offices

**Austin Resource Recovery (ARR) has selected [Recollect](https://recollect.net/) as a vendor. **

ReCollect is a "Solid Waste App for Schedules and Reminders" that other cities have used for the exact type of functionality that is proposed in the redesign of the Open Austin Austin Recycles app. They finalized the contract within the past couple days and intend to begin roll-out in June. One of the main features that Emlea's team was interested in is the ability to push messages via the app.

**Collection Schedules and routes will change significantly in October. **

I made it clear to Emlea & Tiffany that it's important that the underlying data (geojson, etc) remains up to date and available to the public. I also said that whatever data they share with Recollect that powers that 3rd party app needs to be released through the [data.austintexas.gov](http://data.austintexas.gov/) data portal as well. This will probably require some follow-up and assistance from CTM.

**Fort Worth launched Recollect this week. **

**Austin is way behind its recycling goals. **

The best avenue for collaboration between ARR and Open Austin moving forward seems to focus on education and behavioral change around what folks are recycling. The need articulated by ARR is for more engaging ways to communicate what can go in your blue cart. There are also needs around Spanish & Asian languages in any educational promotion. They especially liked this type of project, [RecycleByCity](http://www.recyclebycity.com/guide/tx/austin), which would be pretty simple to recreate and extend.

**CoA is more focused on blue cart and less about multifamily dwellings. **

In spite of this, there is a cool project that recently launched in Chicago that we could fork that aims to shame and point out when a landlord/property manager isn't providing recycling and thus breaking a city ordinance. ARR liked the idea of this app but was hesitant to officially endorse this type of approach. They did say that you can currently report your building via 311, and it gets to their business operations team to enforce.

**Moving forward. **

I am going to update the ARR team with whatever information I gather from the next HackForGood planning meeting. They are going to think about projects and needs that they could pitch at that event. They will also be touching base with Jill for Public Information Offices who's involved in the Hackathon planning.
