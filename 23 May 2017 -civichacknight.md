We also have a slack channel [#iced](https://openaustin.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23iced&via=X4dWFCrzlJU)-coffee, which is a great place to start, as well as new leadership team channels. 

_This will give us a place to point folks depending on how they would like to help and each team leader a place to organize their people and put out the call when there is a need._

**Active Projects**

## Personal Intros

*   **Name**
*   **Personal pronouns (she/her, they/them, he/him, ze/hir)**

        *   We use gender pronouns to make the space more comfortable and inclusive. People may appear differently than they identify. Knowing and asking someone's gender is better and less awkward than misgendering them.
