## Intros
<undefined><li>We're trying to shorten the intros. Please don't take more than 30 seconds.</li></undefined>

*   **Name**
*   **Personal pronouns (she/her, they/them, he/him, ze/hir)**

        *   We use gender pronouns to make the space more comfortable and inclusive. People may appear differently than they identify. Knowing someone's gender is better than misgendering them. 

*   **If you don't have a project:**

        *   What skills or types of projects are you interested in working on?

## Open Austin Project Process

**Code for America has the [four project stages](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages):**

*   experiment
*   alpha
*   beta
*   official

**To start an experiment:**

*   Do something and tell us about it. Open an issue at [](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues)[https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues) and tag it with experiment.
*   Tell us if you need any resources to get started (hosting, cartodb, mockup tools, etc.).
*   Come to an Open Austin event and work on/share your project.
*   Start a Slack channel.

**From experiment to alpha:**

(this is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project):

*   Identify a project champion
*   Get approval from Open Austin
*   List the project on [open-austin.org/projects](https://open-austin.org/projects)
*   Go through a code/architecture review
