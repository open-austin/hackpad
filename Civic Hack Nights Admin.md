# Civic Hack Nights Admin 

This pad is a working guide for organizing a successful Open Austin Civic Hack Night.

## Requesting a Venue

Main requirements

*   Wifi
*   Public transit
*   Parking
*   allows food (not a dealbreaker)

Past venues:

*   WeWork: [Carly Langly](mailto:clangley@wework.com) & [Jordan Parker](mailto:jparker@wework.com)
*   Twin Oaks Branch public library: [Booking APL Rooms](http://library.austintexas.gov/basic-page/meeting-room-reservations-how-guide-group-representatives)
*   Iron Yard: campus director has changed, would need to establish new relationship, Far South but great space
*   <s>BuildASign: Far North, nice big space, but feels a little awkward/corporate</s>
*   <s>Makersquare</s>: no longer hosting meetups
*   <s>Townlake YMCA: no good WIFI</s>

Other Possibilities:

*   Vuka

## Creating the Event

We post our Civic Hack Nights in two main places.

1.  Meetup.com
2.  Our Google Calendar

We could also market our event through event newsletters like (but it's time consuming)

*   Josh Baer's Austin Startup Digest
*   Built in Austin Events
*   etc

## Publicize Event

The week before an event, send reminders via these channels:

*   Reminder through Meetup.com members about upcoming event. [](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Government-Civic-Technology-Meetup-by-Open-Austin/)[http://www.meetup.com/Open-Government-Civic-Technology-Meetup-by-Open-Austin/](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Government-Civic-Technology-Meetup-by-Open-Austin/)
*   Post on the Open Austin Google Group (emails subscribers) [](https://groups.google.com/forum/#)[https://groups.google.com/forum/#](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openaustin)[!forum/openaustin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openaustin)
*   Tweet out event details with link to Meetup.com (via Buffer.com)
*   Reminder on Slack [#general](https://openaustin.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23general) and/or [#hacking](https://openaustin.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23hacking) channels

## Ordering Food

Budget allows for $50 per Meetup with funds via CfA.

[Chipotle Online Ordering](https://order.chipotle.com/) works well for meetups downtown.

PHOTOGRAPH/KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!!!

Share receipt/photo with Chip or Mateo to expense.

## Gathering Meeting Content/Announcements
