## Personal Intros

*   **Name**
*   **Personal pronouns (she/her, they/them, he/him, ze/hir)**

        *   We use gender pronouns to make the space more comfortable and inclusive. People may appear differently than they identify. Knowing and asking someone's gender is better and less awkward than misgendering them.
