# Granny Flats Checkin 23-Apr

 Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)

**Summary**

Much of our discussion revolved around available data.  Ming, a city planner at CoA, shared lots of good information about zoning codes, overlays, metadata, and business processes. We discussed different features, what the user might expect as the work through the app, and what type of information would be valuable for city planners when a user can't build is told they can't ADU.

The core team has already met 3 times and has a Decision Tree worked out. Image stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2XaUzKHex2ffncxN3VWMVFuRmR5OWZ4T2RJS0JxdTJnQ3gxQkZZTUhCS0lKSkhzNzJqWDQ&usp=sharing_eid)

**Next Steps**

*   Sara to set up Trello board to manage tasks.

*   Mateo to invite all to Slack to continue conversation via #grannyflats

*   Create mockups/wireframes, etc to be able to share with developers
*   Recruit developers (NDoCH June Hackathon good environment for this)

**Datasets**

*   Building Footprint (GIS Group at CTM has purchased) - data on unit sizes within parcels.
*   TCAD (question of openness) - square footage data.
*   [AMANDA Permit Database](https://www.austintexas.gov/devreview/a_queryfolder_permits.jsp) - historical record of permit applications
*   Zillow API: [](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm)[http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm) - has sq ft info
*   [Zoning Dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/Geodata/Zoning/5rzy-nm5e) in data.austintexas.org

        *   ZONING ZTY: Zoning String, several components, zoning districts, conditional overlays, historical district, NCCD, neighborhood plan.

**App Specs & Ideas**

*   If app determines that a resident can't build an ADU for whatever reason (ex: they have enough space for lot but not enough for parking requirements), city planners could use that information. App could have a feature that automatically notifies planning department and/or a feature to generate reports on outcomes for users that complete survey/decision tree logic.
*   Ability to follow a user's development project (via follow-up survey). 

        *   Were they able to move forward with the ADU? 
    *   Monitor how its effecting neighborhoods.
    *   How is it being used?
    *   Etc.

*   Current Business Process if you need help figuring out whether you are able to build a ADU:

        *   Development Assistance Center (DAC): Reviewers will help you discover if you can build an ADU

*   With CodeNEXT, the coding restrictions will likely change in the future (2016-17). Decision Tree Logic may change (could be more simplified)
