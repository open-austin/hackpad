**Project Stages**

Code for America now has these official project stages: [](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z33SXl78c3UlO2VOA9SjXTVMHdY9ogjMJBLB6SMN7j0/edit#slide=id.gbb3e3eab5_0_46)https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z33SXl78c3UlO2VOA9SjXTVMHdY9ogjMJBLB6SMN7j0/edit#slide=id.gbb3e3eab5_0_46

Each stage emphasizes getting user feedback.

*   Experiment - Listen to the community, research the problems, and conduct many experiments.
*   Alpha - Talk to users and get feedback. Make project accessible for other contributors.
*   Beta - More users. Write tests. Formalize a government, community or media partner for the project.
*   Official - Launch party. Talk to more users. Focus on user accessibility.
